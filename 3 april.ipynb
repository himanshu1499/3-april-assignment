    "Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm, which means it is designed to predict outcomes that have two possible values, typically 0 or 1. However, there are several ways in which logistic regression can be extended to perform multiclass classification, where the target variable can have more than two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common approach is to use a one-vs-all (also known as one-vs-rest) strategy, where we train multiple binary logistic regression models, one for each class. In this approach, for each class, the logistic regression model is trained to predict whether the sample belongs to that class or not. The decision rule then becomes selecting the class with the highest predicted probability across all the binary models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use a multinomial logistic regression (also known as softmax regression), which allows us to predict the probability of each class directly. In this approach, the logistic regression model is trained on a categorical dependent variable that has more than two categories, and the predicted probabilities for each class are calculated using the softmax function. The softmax function converts the output of the logistic regression into a probability distribution over the possible classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches can be effective for multiclass classification, and the choice between them depends on the specific problem and the performance metrics being used. The one-vs-all approach is often simpler and easier to implement, while the multinomial logistic regression approach provides more direct and interpretable results."
